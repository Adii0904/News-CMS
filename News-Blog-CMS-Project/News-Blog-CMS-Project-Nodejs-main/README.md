# News Blog CMS Project in NodeJS & ExpressJS 

A News Blog CMS (Content Management System) project built with Node.js and MongoDB offers a robust and flexible solution for managing and publishing news articles and blog posts. This technology stack is a popular choice due to its "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, allowing developers to use a single language for both client-side and server-side development, streamlining the development process.
